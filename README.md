# 4E-Homework-Page

For Phillip Henri's 4E Homework website.
The plan for this project is to have a website that can be visited and you can view what the class has for homework due within a month.

The website is practically useless, as much more is to be completed.
It is styled with an external CSS sheet and is written with HTML and CSS.
